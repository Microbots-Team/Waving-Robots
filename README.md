# 🤖 Waving-Robot

## 💡 Project Overview
this project is an interactive exhibition project that enhances visitor engagement through a simple yet delightful interaction.  
When a visitor approaches, the character **automatically waves** to greet them — creating a friendly and dynamic experience.  

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how **motion sensing and servo control** can be used to make technology feel more human and interactive in public exhibitions or installations.
